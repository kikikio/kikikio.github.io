I am a first-year Master student with the College of Computer and Data Science at Fuzhou University, China. I received my B.Eng. degrees from Fuzhou University in 2022. My advisor is [Prof. Dong Zhang](https://ccds.fzu.edu.cn/info/1206/5188.htm) (Fuzhou University). My current researches focus on packet classification, network measurement, and programmable networks.
